# Minicraft_CheerpJ
Run Minicraft in the browser(the source has been modified to be compatible with CheerpJ)
Minicraftfixed.zip has both the source and the jar and is the first version, which doesnt display stamina.
Minicraftfinal.zip is the final version, which you should play.
You need to have the CheerpJ Applet Runner extension installed and you also have to host the files on a web server to play this!
